The lid especially is the worst lid I have ever come across. To be honest I read a review that said the lid was bad but didn't expect it to be that bad. If the lid wasn't a problem then I would have no issue with the case cause it fits all the hardware that I need and has okay cooling. Might get a low profile CPU Cooler so I can install a second intake fan. Since I only have 1 140mm fan and 1 120mm fan. Trying to decide between a micro-atx build with this new case or get the define nano s and stay with mini-itx. Would prefer small form factor but want proper cooling and airflow above everything.",

Overall temps are pretty good in this case and I am getting 35 degrees after playing a few hours of Skyrim Special Edition on ultra graphics at 1080p with a few graphics mods thrown in. Not the most demanding of games but just wanted to give you a bit of an idea what temps are like thanks to the Corsair h100i v2. I have my AIO fans set as exhaust and two red led intake fans at the front and one more exhaust fans at the back. It's been working pretty well so far and I like the window. A nice decent build. Small enough to be portable but big enough so I can upgrade, tweak, or fix things if I need/want to. I would highly suggest the Nano S if you are not going to do SLI/Crossfire or have any other kind of expansion cards. Great for air/water cooling and can take a few hard drives as well.",

In particular a standard ATX PSU will overheat the GPU unless the GPU is a blower or watercooled. Alternatively you can use a SFF PSU but they run a lot warmer than ATX PSU, putting a lot of hot air in the small case. This may be less of an issue with a SFF long as they have a slightly larger fan. I'm considering getting this case as I can't afford a decent water loop in my nano case.",

        "commentText": "+Tom Brown The reason i'm curious is because with the Nano S case I had a GTX 980Ti G1 with a standard ATX PSU. Sitting so close the PSU was overheating the GPU. I changed to a SFX Silverstone SX600 which worked but it was putting out a fair amount of heat and had a faint buzzing sound. I'd really suggest a SFX-L PSU, the bigger fan the better. Alternatively run a blower GPU or even better a water cooling block on the GPU. It's a nice case but cooling is more difficult due to the confines.",
